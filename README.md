A boilerplate for react apps 

## There are like a million of these

Most of them suffer from one or more of

- Way too much magic and shit, I don't understand what's happening
- Too many opinions
- Trying to get rid of opinions breaks the whole thing
- Complexity through features that are not actually needed

... which result in inability to improve on them on a per-project basis.

- I want to understand what's happening - 100% of the time
- I want to be able to edit the setup without breaking everything
- I want to KISS

## Contains

- JSX + SASS -> React app
- Gulp runs builds and webpack
- Gulp also lints for you if you're a notepad warrior
